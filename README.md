Hi! I'm a PhD student in Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) @ the University of California, Berkeley. I am working with [Professor Alexandre Bayen](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/bayen.html), researching Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling and control of physical systems governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). My current projects focus on large-scale traffic networks and shallow water flow systems.

### About Me
* I earned my B.S. in Systems Engineering and B.S. in Computer Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 2023
* I completed my M.S. in Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis in 2023, advised by [Dr. Neal Patwari](https://www.cs.utah.edu/patwari-neal/)
* I furthered my M.S. research in wireless testbeds at the University of Utah, also advised by [Dr. Neal Patwari](https://www.cs.utah.edu/patwari-neal/)

* I love art: making my own jewelry, decorations, gifts & cards, accessories
* Hiking is my happy place & I have a National Parks bucket list
* I am an avid rock climber
